wxWorkspaceView is a control for [wxWidgets](http://www.wxWidgets.org) (currently only tested with wxWidgets 2.8.0). It provides a fully interactive graphical representation of a graph. Custom drawing code can be provided to personalize the view. Custom elements can also be added for further personalization.

Here's a screenshot of wxWorkspaceView in action:
